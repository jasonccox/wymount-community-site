              The Wymount Terrace Office (located in the <a href="img/wymount_map_mpb.pdf" target="_">Multi-Purpose Building</a>) is open from 8:00am-8:00pm Monday-Friday and can lend you a key.
              If the Wymount Office is closed, the Heritage Central Building Office can lend you a key from 8:00pm-12:00am Monday-Friday, 7:00am-12:00pm Saturday, and 10:00am-10:00pm Sunday.
              As a last resort, call BYU Police at (801) 422-2222 if neither of these offices is open.

                  The parking stalls here are numbered for convenience only, so a car can't be ticketed or towed for parking in your spot. 
                  However, if the same car has been parked in your spot for more than a day, feel free to <a href="#contact" class="jq-scroll">let us know</a> so that we can try to help.
                </p>
                <p>Please don't leave your own notes on others' cars. We have slips explaining the parking policy that you can place on cars -- <a href="#contact" class="jq-scroll">let us know</a> if you'd like one.</p>
                <p>Also, remember that whoever is parked in your spot probably isn't on the ward Facebook page (and whomever they're visiting is probably busy with their guests, not checking the page themselves), so posting there rarely does any good.</p>

            <div class="faq__a">
                <p>Any unmarked stalls are designated as visitor spots. There are a few of these visitor spots in each parking lot, and the lot next to the <a href="img/wymount_map_mpb.pdf" target="_">Multi-Purpose Building</a> is all visitor stalls.</p>

                <p>Yes, you can. Let us know at least 24 hours in advance so we can unlock the gates, and be sure to get a permit from the office (located in the <a href="img/wymount_map_mpb.pdf" target="_">Multi-Purpose Building</a> and open 8:00am-8:00pm Monday-Friday).</p>
